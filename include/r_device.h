/**
    Supported Modulation and Coding types.

    Note that Modulation is a term used usually to refer to the analog domain.
    We refer to Modulation for the process of (de-)modulating a digital line code,
    represented as pulses and gaps (OOK) or mark and space (FSK) onto a RF carrier signal.
    The line code is a coding of the bitstream data and refered to as the Coding of the data.

    We however use the well known terms to refer to the combinations of this.
    E.g. the term PWM is well known as anlog or discrete range modulation, but here used
    to refer to a binary Coding of bits to on and off states (or mark and space) of the carrier.
    It should be thought of as Pulse-Width-Coding, then modulated on OOK or FSK.
    I.e. it is not truly Pulse-Width-Modulation but Pulse-Width-Coding then OOK or FSK modulation.
    This might be especially confusing with PCM, where there is no true Pulse-Code-Modulation,
    but rather NRZ (or RZ) pulse code with then OOK or FSK modulation.
