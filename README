rtl_433, turns your Realtek RTL2832 based DVB dongle into a 433.92MHz generic data receiver
======================================================================

Installation instructions:

cd rtl_433/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make


Running:

./rtl_433 -h

Usage:  [-d device_index (default: 0)]
    [-g gain (default: 0 for auto)]
    [-a analyze mode, print a textual description of the signal]
    [-l change the detection level used to determine pulses (0-32000) default 10000]
    [-f change the receive frequency, default is 433.92MHz]
    [-S force sync output (default: async)]
    [-r read data from file instead of from a receiver]
    filename (a '-' dumps samples to stdout)


./rtl_433 -a will run in analyze mode and you will get a text log of the received signal.
./rtl_433 -a file_name will save the demodulated signal in a file. The format of the file is 48kHz 16 bit samples.
./rtl_433 will run the software in receive mode. Some sensor data can be receviced.

This software is mostly useable for developers right now.
