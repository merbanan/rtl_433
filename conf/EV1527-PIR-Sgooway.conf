# EV1527 based passive infrared sensor
#
# This decoder reads detections of the Sgooway EV1527 based PIR
# 
# The shown example can distinguish between multiple of those PIR's (two in this case)
# and present the different PIR's as "channel : x" in the output. Adopt this line
# to your EV1527 unique codes. Put the decimal representation of the in here.
#
# If this is not desired, a simple "match=abcde" can limit the detection of
# one unique EV1527 code.
