/**
TPMS sensor for Kio Rio III (UB) 2011-2017 and some Hyundai models. Possibly other brands and
models too.

The sensors have accelerometers that sense the centripetal force in a spinning wheel and begin
to transmit data around 40 km/h. They usually keep transmitting for several minutes after
stopping, but not always; on a few rare occasions they stop instantly. Each sensor sends a
burst of 4-6 packets two times a minutes. The packets in a burst are often, but not always,
identical.

154 bits in a packet. Bit layout (leftmost bit in a field is the most significant):
    zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz aaaa pppppppp tttttttt iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii dddddddd ccccc

Legend:
    z: 16-bit preamble = 0xed71. Must be omitted from Manchester-decoding
    a: Unknown, but 0xf in all my own readings
    p: 8-bit pressure given as PSI * 5
    t: 8-bit temperature given as Celcius + 50
    i: 32-bit Sensor ID
    d: Unknown, with different value in each packet
    c: First 5 bits of CRC. We need to append 000 to reach 8 bits. poly=0x07, init=0x76.

NOTE: I often get pressure and temperature values that are outliers (like 200 C or 10 PSI) from
all four sensors, even when CRC is OK. I don't know if all my sensors are defunct or if I have
missed something in the encoding. I have included a "raw" field to make it easier for other
users to investigate it.

NOTE: You may need to use the "-s 1000000" option of rtl_433 in order to get a clear signal.
