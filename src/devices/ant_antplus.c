ANT and ANT+ decoder.

ANT and ANT+ communication standards are defined by a division of Garmin
https://www.thisisant.com/ and used widely for low power devices.
The ANT radio transmits for less than 150 Âµs per message, allowing a single
channel to be divided into hundreds of time slots and avoiding collisions.
ANT and ANT+ devices use a modified Shockburst protocol, in the 2.4GHz ISM band,
with 160kHz deviation and 1Mbps data rates, GFSK encoded. The low level
layer is not documented anywhere. ANT chips use an 8 byte key to generate a 2 byte
network ID using an unspecified algorithm. Valid keys are only assigned by Garmin
and require specific licensing terms (and in some cases a payment)
ANT+ uses the basic ANT message structure but is a managed network with a specific
network key and defined device types, each sending "data pages" of 8 bytes with
specific data for the device type. Most ANT+ devices are sports focused like
heart rate monitors, bicycle sensors, or environmental sensors.

Please note that unlike most devices in the rtl_433 repository, ANT+ devices
operate in the ISM band between 2.4GHz and 2.5GHz. Decoding these signals
requires an SDR capable of operating above 2.4GHz (e.g. PlutoSDR) or the
use of a downconverter for rtl_sdr. The ISM band is very noisy, so it's
recommended to get the device very close, use only a ~30mm wire antenna and
use mid-low gains. Finally, since the protocol encodes at 1Mbps, sampling
rate should be -s 4M or higher. It can work with a sampling rate as low as
2Msps, but unreliably. To avoid excessive warnings when running with default
250k sampling rate, the decoder is disabled by default.

The following works well with PlutoSDR:

rtl_433 -d driver=plutosdr,uri=ip:192.168.2.1 -g 20 -f 2457.025M -s 4M

Without knowing the 8 byte key, existing ANT chips do not allow sniffing
of the data packets. Hence the need for this decoder. At the moment it's
not possible to recover the ANT key from the 16 bit on-air network key.

This decoder only captures and displays the low-level packets, identifying the
2 byte network key plus all other device characteristics and 8 byte ANT payload.
It identifies ANT+ packets using the unique network key used (0xa6c5)
Refer to ANT+ documentation for ech specific device to parse the content of
the pages sent as 8 byte ANT+ payload.

The ANT protocol is using an uncommon strategy for the preamble: either 0x55 or
0xaa, depending on the value of the first bit of the following byte (0 and 1
respectively). The nRF24L01, on which the ANT protocol is based, uses the same
preamble strategy. In order to determine if the packet is using 0x55 or 0xaa,
both packets are extracted and the only valid one is determined by matching
the packet CRC with a calculated CRC value for both alternative packets.

The payload is 18 bytes long structured as follows:

    PNNDDTXLPPPPPPPPCC

- P: Preamble: either 0x55 or 0xAA, depending on the value of first bit of the next byte
- N: Network key, assume LSB first (ANT+ uses 0xc5a6, most invalid keys 0x255b)
- D: Device number, 16 bit. LSB first
- X: Transmission type
- L: ANT payload length including CRC
- P: 8 byte ANT or ANT+ payload
- C: 16 bit CRC (CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE)

Weirdly, L is always 10, because at the moment the ANT payload is always 8 bytes
