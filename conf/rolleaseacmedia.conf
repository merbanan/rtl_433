# Decoder for rolleaseacmedia mains powered roller blind motor controller

# The device tested is MTRF-REM-15CLED
# 433.92MHz
# rolleaseacmedia.com
# FCC ID: VYY-DD5712

# Note. There is another controller of identical apearance and FCC ID which uses a different (incompatable) protocol to operate battery powered roller blinds.

# I have tested commands for blind up, blind stop and blind down. 
# The controller appears to be capable of proportional level setting, 
# but my blind motors do not appear to support this function, 
# so I have been unable to test proportional level control.

# Schema of signal is <7 hex byte controller address><1 hex byte compliment of channel number><2 hex byte command>
# Up and down commands are sent as a pair of repeated commands.
# Stop command is sent as a single repeated command.
# The number of repeats received is quite variable, usually between 3 and 7.

# Channel number is complement of the eigth hex byte. Thus    0xf = channel 0
#                                                            0xe = channel 1
#                                                                ...
#                                                            0x0 = channel 15    

# Up commands are:
#    Burst of about 6 repeats of:                <7 byte controler address><1 byte channel><ee>
#    followed by a burst of about 6 repeats of:  <7 byte controler address><1 byte channel><e1>

# Stop commands are:    
#    Burst of about 6 repeats of:                <7 byte controler address><1 byte channel><aa>

# Down commands are:
#    Burst of about 6 repeats of:                <7 byte controler address><1 byte channel><cc>
#    followed by a burst of about 6 repeats of:  <7 byte controler address><1 byte channel><c3>
