/**
Watchman Sonic Advanced/Plus oil tank level monitor.

Tested devices:
- Watchman Sonic Advanced

The devices uses GFSK with 500 us long and short pulses.
Using -Y minmax should be sufficient to get it to work.

Total length of message including preamble is 192 bits.
The format might be most easily summarised in a BitBench string:

    PRE: 40b SYNC: 16h MODEL: 24h ID: 24d 8h TEMP: 8h 16h DEPTH: 8d 32h CRC: 16h

Data Layout:

- 40 bits of preamble, i.e. 10101010 etc.
- 0x2dd4 - 'standard' sync word
- 1 byte - message length, fixed 0x0e (14)
- 2 byte - fixed 0x0401 - presumably a model identifier, common at least to the two devices we have tested this on
- 0x0e0401 - presumably a model identifier, common at least to the two devices we have tested this on
- 3 byte integer serial number - as printed on a label attached to the device itself
- 1 byte status:
  - 0xC0 - during the first 20ish minutes after sync with the receiver when the device is transmitting once per second
  - 0x80 - the first one or two transmissions after the sync period when the device seems to be calibrating itself
  - 0x98 - normal, live value that you'll see on every transmission when the device is up and running
- 1 byte temperature, in intervals of 0.5 degrees, offset by 0x48
- two more varying bytes which could be the raw sensor reading
- 1 byte integer depth (i.e. the distance between the sensor and the oil in the tank)
- 0x01050300 - 4 bytes of constant values which could be a version number? (1.5.3.0)
- 2 byte CRC-16 poly 0x8005 init 0
