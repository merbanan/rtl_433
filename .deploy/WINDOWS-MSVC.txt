# rtl_433 Windows MSVC build

For the SoapySDR builds you need PothosSDR installed https://downloads.myriadrf.org/builds/PothosSDR/
Any recent version should work, currently built with 2021.07.25-vc16:
https://downloads.myriadrf.org/builds/PothosSDR/PothosSDR-2021.07.25-vc16-x64.exe
When installing choose "Add PothosSDR to the system PATH for the current user"

For the TLS builds (mqtts and influxs) you need OpenSSL installed.
E.g. install Chocolatey https://chocolatey.org/install
then run `choco install openssl.light`

An alternative to installing SoapySDR from PothosSDR is to extract the installer
and copy the builds (.exe) from this release to the `bin` directory in PothosSDR.

This release includes the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015, 2017 and 2019.
