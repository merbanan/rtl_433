/**
Watchman Sonic Advanced/Plus oil tank level monitor.

The devices uses GFSK with 500 us long and short pulses.
Using -Y minmax should be sufficient to get it to work.

Total length of message including preamble is 192 bits.
The format might be most easily summarised in a BitBench string:

PRE: 40b SYNC: 16h MODEL: 24h ID: 24d 8h TEMP: 8h 16h DEPTH: 8d 32h CRC: 16h

In more detail:

- 40 bits of preamble, i.e. 10101010 etc.
- 0x2dd4 - 'standard' sync word
- 0x0e0401 - presumably a model identifier, common at least to the two devices we have tested this on
- 3 byte integer serial number - as printed on a label attached to the device itself
- 0x80 - so far, this seems to be constant
- 1 byte temperature, in intervals of 0.5 degrees, offset by 0x48
- two more varying bytes currently of unknown purpose
- 1 byte integer depth (i.e. the distance between the sensor and the oil in the tank)
- 0x01050300 - 4 bytes of constant values
- 2 byte CRC

Tested devices:
- Watchman Sonic Advanced
