#  Driveway alarm sensor  SKU I8-W1901
#  This sensor Detects motion and comes with a receiver that plays 32 different
#  melodies at selectable volumes. The receiver with the speaker plugs into a
#  120Vac outlet and the motion sensor is powered by 3 AAA batteries. The plastic
#  material is high quality and has brass inserts for the battery cover screws.
#  The receiver (that comes with the sensor) has the ability to pair with 4
#  different sensors.

#    SKU: I8-W1901
#    On Amazon it is sold by FREETIM, but the packaging does not mention this name
#    anywhere; it  is unbranded.
#  It is a 433.92 Mhz device and it repeatedly  sends two rows of data when motion
#  is detected:
#                      ----------------------------------
#                            Data             Length
#  - first row                8               01 bit (artifact of sync bit)
#  - second row          <device id>          25 bits
#                      ----------------------------------
#  There is no additional data provided by the sensor, it simply detects motion.
#
#  The following flex decoder was used for the above analysis.
#     $ rtl_433 -R 0 -X 'n=driveway,m=OOK_PWM,s=200,l=596,r=6196,g=608,t=158,y=0,repeats>=10,bits>=20'
#       repeats>=10 and bits>=20 was used to filter out any possible noise.
#
#  Decoder
#  -------
#  After discussion with zuckschwerdt (https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433/pull/2493)
#  we decided to include the sync bit into the packet (for robustness) by increasing
#  the gap limit to 900 us and then matching on 26 bits as the ID. This gives us a
#  flex decoder like this:
#   $ rtl_433 -R 0 -X 'n=motion,m=OOK_PWM,s=188,l=588,r=7000,g=900,t=160,y=0,match={26}c4ea674,repeats>=3'
#
#  How to use
#  ----------
#  1. Run rtl_433 -R 0 -X 'n=motion,m=OOK_PWM,s=188,l=588,r=7000,g=900,t=160,y=0,repeats>=3,bits>=26'
#  2. Activate the motion sensor, and write down the hex value of the 26 bits you get
#  3. Replace the value in the match= line below with the one you just got
#
#  Voila! Enjoy!
#
#  This sensor was tested at about 45 meters of distance and through layers of wood
#  and walls and it worked well.
