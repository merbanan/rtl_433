Installation using cmake:

    cd rtl_433/
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make
    make install

Installation using autoconf:

    cd rtl_433/

		 3 = Raw I/Q samples (cf32, 2 channel)
		 Note: If output file is specified, input will always be I/Q
	[-F] kv|json|csv Produce decoded output in given format. Not yet supported by all drivers.
	[<filename>] Save data stream to output file (a '-' dumps samples to stdout)

Examples:

| Command | Description
|---------|------------
| `rtl_433` | Default receive mode, attempt to decode all known devices
| `rtl_433 -p NN -R 1 -R 9 -R 36 -R 40` | Typical usage: Enable device decoders for desired devices. Correct rtl-sdr tuning error (ppm offset).
| `rtl_433 -a` | Will run in analyze mode and you will get a text description of the received signal.
| `rtl_433 -A` | Enable pulse analyzer. Summarizes the timings of pulses, gaps, and periods. Can be used in either the normal decode mode, or analyze mode.
| `rtl_433 -a -t` | Will run in analyze mode and save a test file per detected signal (gfile###.data). Format is uint8, 2 channels.
| `rtl_433 -r file_name` | Play back a saved data file. 
| `rtl_433 file_name` | Will save everything received from the rtl-sdr during the session into a single file. The saves file may become quite large depending on how long rtl_433 is left running. Note: saving signals into individual files wint `rtl_433 -a -t` is preferred.

This software is mostly useable for developers right now.


Supporting Additional Devices and Test Data
-------------------------------------------

The first step in decoding new devices is to record the signals using `-a -t`. The signals will be
stored individually in files named gfileNNN.data that can be played back with `rtl_433 -r gfileNNN.data`.

These files are vital for understanding the signal format as well as the message data.  Use both analyzers
`-a` and `-A` to look at the recorded signal and determine the pulse characteristics, e.g. `rtl_433 -r gfileNNN.data -a -A`.

Make sure you have recorded a proper set of test signals representing different conditions together
with any and all information about the values that the signal should represent. For example, make a
note of what temperature and/or humidity is the signal encoding. Ideally, capture a range of data
values, such a different temperatures, to make it easy to spot what part of the message is changing.

Add the data files, a text file describing the captured signals, pictures of the device and/or
a link the manufacturer's page (ideally with specifications) to the rtl_433_tests
github repository. Follow the existing structure as best as possible and send a pull request.

https://github.com/merbanan/rtl_433_tests

Please don't open a new github issue for device support or request decoding help from others
until you've added test signals and the description to the repository.

The rtl_433_test repository is also used to help test that changes to rtl_433 haven't caused any regressions.
