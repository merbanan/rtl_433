Protocol Description
________________________________
Bits 00 to 02 are a 976 ms RF front porch pulse, providing a wake up period that allows the
     system controller receiver to synchronize with the incoming packet.
Bits 3 to 14 include 12 sync pulses, e.g., logical 0's, to synchronize the receiver.
Bit 15 is a start pulse, e.g., a logical 1, that tells the receiver that data is to follow.
Bits 16-58 provide information regarding the transmitter and associated sensor. In other
     embodiments, bits 16-58 may be replaced by an analog signal.
Bits 16 to 35 provide a 20-bit sensor identification code that uniquely identifies the particular
     sensor sending the message. Bits 36 to 39 provide a 4 bit device-type code that identifies the
     specific-type of sensor, e.g., smoke, PIR, door, window, etc. The combination of the sensor
     bits and device bits provide a set of data bits.
Bits 40 through 42 provide a 3-bit trigger count that is incremented for each group of message
     packets. The trigger count is a simple but effective way for preventing a third party from
     recording a message packet transmission and then re-transmitting that message packet
     transmission to make the system controller think that a valid message packet is being transmitted.
Bit 43 provides the low battery bit.
Bits 44 through 53 provide the latch bit value and the debounced value for each of the five inputs
     associated with the transmitter. For the F5 input, both a positive and negative latch bit are provided.
Bit 55 provides even parity over odd bits 15 to 55.
Bit 56 provides odd parity over even bits 16 to 56.
Bit 57 is a programmable bit that can be used for a variety of applications, including providing an
     additional bit that could be used for the sensor identification code or device type code.
Bit 58 is a 366 ms RF on signal that functions as the "old" stop bit. This bit provides compatibility with
     prior system controllers that may be programmed to receive a 58-bit message.
Bit 59 is a logical 1.
Bits 60 to 62 are a modulus eight count of the number of 1 bits in bits 15 through 54, providing enhanced
     error detection information to be used by the system controller. Finally, bit 63 is the "new" stop bit,
     e.g., a logical 0, that tells the system controller that it is the end of the message packet.

Addendum
_______________________________
GE/Interlogix keyfobs do not follow the documented iti protocol and it
    appears the protocol was misread by the team that created the keyfobs.
    The button states are sent in the three trigger count bits (bit 40-42)
    and no battery status appears to be provided. 4 buttons and a single
    multi-button press (buttons 1 - lock and buttons 2 - unlock) for a total
    of 5 buttons available on the keyfob.
For contact sensors, latch 3 (typically the tamper/case open latch) will
    float (giving misreads) if the external contacts are used (ie; closed)
    and there is no 4.7 Kohm end of line resistor in place on the external
    circuit
