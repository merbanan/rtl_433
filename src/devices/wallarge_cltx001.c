/**
WallarGe CLTX001 Outdoor Temperature Sensor.

FCC ID: 2AYIQ-TX100 (https://fcc.report/FCC-ID/2AYIQ-TX100)

Can be purchased individually (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CB17H77R/) or
bundled with WallarGe clocks like the CL6007 (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D9BNSQCS)
and CL7001 (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BYNJW532, http://www.us-wallarge.com/item/3015.html).

Modulation:

HIGH/LOW periods are multiples of 250 µs long.
The following uses '-' for HIGHs and '_' for LOWs lasting 250 µs, respectively.

1) Preamble: -___ or --___ (single pulse followed by a 750 µs gap)

   Sometimes, the initial pulse is too short and gets ignored by rtl_433.
   When it does get registered by rtl_433, the following gap exceeds the
   configured gap limit of 650 µs, resulting in a row with a single bit.
   This prevents the bit from becoming part of the following row,
   making that row easier to decode.

2) Payload with 0 = -__ and 1 = --_ (750 µs per symbol)

   rtl_433 interprets this as 1 = -__ and 0 = --_, so we have to invert the data.

   Sometimes, the transmitter seems to skip ahead by 250 µs and/or flip a bit.
   In such cases, rtl_433 may drop some bits and split the row instead.
   These partial rows are currently ignored.

   For some reason these issues mainly affect periodic transmissions as opposed to
   transmissions that occur immediately after changing the transmitter's channel.

3) Separator: _---___---___ (preceding each repeated payload)

   When the payload ends with --_, rtl_433 will see two gaps exceeding the limit:
   ...--__---___---___
             ^^^   ^^^
   When the payload ends with -__, rtl_433 will see three gaps exceeding the limit:
   ...-___---___---___
       ^^^   ^^^   ^^^
   For each of the gaps exceeding the configured limit it will close the current row,
   resulting in either one or two empty rows occurring between rows with data.

The payload gets sent five times per transmission.

Payload encoding:

    56 bits / 7 bytes

            _Binary_
    Byte 1: IIIIIIII Bits 1 to  8 of a uint16_t sensor ID
    Byte 2: IIIIIIII Bits 9 to 16 of a uint16_t sensor ID
    Byte 3: 00000000 Always zero, unknown purpose, ignored by clock
    Byte 4: B        Battery status (0 = okay, 1 = low)
             M       Test mode (0 = off, 1 = on)
              CC     2-bit channel ID (0 = A, 1 = B, 2 = C)
                TTTT Bits 1 to  4 of an "int12_t" temperature reading
    Byte 5: TTTTTTTT Bits 5 to 12 of an "int12_t" temperature reading
    Byte 6: PPPPP    Parity data - even number of set bits in byte N => bit N = 1, else 0
                 000 Always zero, clock rejects signal otherwise
    Byte 7: SSSSSSSS Checksum, sum of bytes 1-5 (indexes 0-4) modulo 256

Battery mode:

    Only reported when the battery is low.

Test mode:

    Only reported when turned on (not used by the CLTX001).

    The sensor transmits immediately after plugging in a battery or selecting a different
    channel, and every 31/33/35 seconds thereafter for channels A/B/C, respectively.

    Normally the clock will turn its receiver off after receiving a signal until the
    sensor is expected to transmit its next signal.

    Test mode overrides this behavior and the clock will keep the receiver on.

Channel ID:

    The CLTX001 transmitter and matching clocks only support three channels, but
    value 3 = D may also occur while changing the transmitter's channel.

Temperature reading:

    12 bit signed integer (two's complement) representing 0.1°C increments in temperature.
    Range: -204.8 to 204.7°C
    The clock will show HH.H above 70°C (158°F) and LL.L below -40°C (-40°F)
