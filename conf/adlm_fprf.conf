# Equation/Siemens ADLM FPRF on 433.863MHz
# 3 zones heater programmer
#
# A 50ms wakeup pulse followed by a 5ms gap,
# then a start pulse 5ms gap + 3ms pulse followed by 41 data pulses.
# This is repeated 3 times with the next wakeup directly following
# the preceding stop pulses.
#
# Bit width is 2000 us with
# Short pulse: ___- 1500us gap +  500 us pulse
# Long pulse:  _---  500us gap + 1500 us pulse
#
# This is a electric heater programmer sold in France by Leroy Merlin on the brand Equation.
# It is manufactured by Siemens, and also has the mark RDE100.1 FPRF on the PCB
