 * A packet may look like this:
 * Position: 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10
 * Packet:   ff ff ff ff 52 cf fc ff 00 49 ff  (Normal packet, 81.4kg, with infinate resistance)
 *           ff ff ff ff 52 d1 fc ff 00 79 ff  (Normal packet, 81.6kg, with infinate resistance)
 *           ff ff ff ff 52 cf fc 78 ff 39 ff  (Normal packet, with "normal" resistance) 
 * Inverted: 00 00 00 00 AD 2E 03 00 FF 86 00  (Normal packet, 81.4kg with infinate resistance)
 * 00 to 03: Preamble, ffh inverted
 * 04: Upper half nibble is preamble, 5h (inverted)
 * 04: Lower half nibble is unknown. Battery status?
 * 05 06: Weight in hectograms, reverse order, 032Eh = 814 hectograms = 81.4kg
 * 07 08: Impedance? reverse order ff78h = 0087h = 135 ohm? Probably needs scaling by approx 5.5.
 * 09: Upper half nibble is checksum; invert numbers, add each nibble from 04 to 08 together, modulus 16
 * 09: Lower half nibble is postamble, 9h (inverted)
 * 10: Postamble, ffh inverted
 *
 * Beurer support, kd@beurer.de, stated these are used for the calculations on the remote display:
 *
 * Water:
 *   Limitations in Anthropometric Calculations of Total Body Water, journal of the American Society of Nephrology, Copyright 2001
 * Muscle:
 *   Estimation of skeletal muscle mass by bioelectrical impedance analysis, J. Appl. Physiol, Copyright 2000
 * Bone:
 *   Body composition following hemodialysis: studies using dual energy X ray absorptiometry and bioelectrical impedance analysis.
 *   Osteoporos Int., Copyright 1993
 *   Abnormal body composition and reduced bone mass in growth hormone deficient hypopituitary adults.
 *   Clin Endocrinol (Oxf), Copyright 1995
 *
 * However, when working through the formula for "bone", my calculations do not match what the display shows, 
 * ~1.44% different for body fat calculations.
  *
 * Beurer support could/would not provide any additional clarifications;
 *   Please note that due to our software of the scale and tolerances, deviations may occur.
 *   Please understand that we can not provide you with any further information beyond the data mentioned above
