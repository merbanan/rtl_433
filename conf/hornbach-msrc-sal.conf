# Decoder for Hornbach awning remotes.
#
# The remote is labeled MSRC-SAL and has article number 6196477 printed on the
# label [0]. On the inside there's a chip with its markings removed, but it
# looks like an off-the-shelf, generic remote. There are multiple LED positions,
# where only one is soldered. There's unused keys, an unlabeled one on the
# front, which does not even emit an RC signal, and one on the back, 'time',
# without even a button behind it, nor was there a spot on the PCB for a key.
#
# There is also another sort of remote, which includes a wind-sensor [1].
# It is assumed that it functions just like a remote, taking light and wind
# into account to send the close signal.
#
# It should probably be mentioned, that Hornbach itself is likely not the
# manufacturer itself.
#
# The remote operates on a 433.92 MHz frequency. The PCB is labeled
# 'DC104-HD V1.3' and seems to be produced in 2019-07-04.
#
# Hornbach awnings use OOK_PWM encoding.
# - 0 is defined as a 372 µs pulse followed by a 744 µs gap.
# - 1 is defined as a 744 µs pulse followed by a 372 µs gap.
# - reset is defined as a 1116 gap followed by a 7812 µs gap.
# - sync is defined as a 4836 µs pulse, followed by a 1488 µs gap.
#
# > __Note:__ It is unclear if the last space (gap) of a bit is always extended
# to a certain length, or if this is an additional delimiter. One could argue
# the reset/delimiter is a 8928 µs gap.
#
# Transmissions starts with a sync and gap pulse, followed by 40 bits, closed
# off with a gap and reset pulse.
# These seem to be repeated at least 4 times, depending on how long the button
# is kept pressed. The exception is the light, which is never repeated more than
# 4 times, which is also visible on the remotes activity LED.
#
# Possible packet layout:
# It starts with 32 bits Remote ID, possibly a combination of vendor + function
# as commonly seen in infra-red remote controls. These are likely remote-unique.
# When programming the awning to match a new/different remote, one is expected
# to press `P2` during power-on, which the awning will acknowledge with some
# beeps. Since the code does not change when pushing `P2`, this is a fair
# assumption, but an assumption still.
#
# Following the remote ID we have a single byte that indicates the button.
#
#   | Button   | Byte | Bits             | Function                            |

#   | MODE     |   3e | 0 0 1 1  1 1 1 0 | Unknown/Undocumented                |
#   | STOP     |   aa | 1 0 1 0  1 0 1 0 | Stop awning at current position     |
#   | DOWN rel |   c3 | 1 1 0 0  0 0 1 1 | Release of button DOWN              |
#   | DOWN     |   cc | 1 1 0 0  1 1 0 0 | Open awning (via internal endstop)  |
#   | UP rel   |   e1 | 1 1 1 0  0 0 0 1 | Release of button UP                |
#   | UP       |   ee | 1 1 1 0  1 1 1 0 | Close awning (via internal endstop) |
#   | LIGHT    |   f0 | 1 1 1 1  0 0 0 0 | Light high/low/off                  |
#
# The UP/DOWN buttons are the only buttons that sends a release event when the
# key is released on the remote. If the button is kept pressed until the remote
# stops the signal, the UP/DOWN (release) key is not sent. Interestingly the
# release events is the inverse of the last nibble of the press event. They are
# ignored by the awning, which makes sense, as it is already moving.
