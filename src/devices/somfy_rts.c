/**
Somfy RTS.

Protocol description:
The protocol is very well defined under the following two links:
[1] https://pushstack.wordpress.com/somfy-rts-protocol/
[2] https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/bd/ae/4f/bf24e41e0161ca/US8189620.pdf

Each frame consists of a preamble with hardware and software sync pulses followed by the manchester encoded data pulses.
A rising edge describes a data bit 1 and a falling edge a data bit 0. The preamble is different for the first frame and
for retransmissions. In the end, the signal is first decoded using an OOK PCM decoder and within the callback, only the
data bits will be manchester decoded.

In the following, each character representing a low level "_" and a high level "^" is roughly 604 us long.

First frames' preamble:

    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^___________^^^^____^^^^____^^^^^^^^_

The first long pulse is often wrongly detected, so I just make sure that it ends up in another row during decoding and
then only consider the rows containing the second part of the first frame preamble.

Retransmission frames' preamble:

    ^^^^____^^^^____^^^^____^^^^____^^^^____^^^^____^^^^____^^^^^^^^_

On some devices (see #2356) the preamble is two bytes shorter apparently?

The data is manchester encoded _^ represents a 1 and ^_ represents a 0. The data section consists of 56 bits that equals
7 bytes of scrambled data. The data is scrambled by XORing each following byte with the last scrambled byte. After
descrambling, the 7 bytes have the following meaning conting byte from left to right as in big endian byte order:

- byte 0:   called "random" in [1] and "key" in [2], in the end it is just the seed for the scrambler
- byte 1:   The higher nibble represents the control command, the lower nibble is the frame's checksum calculated by XORing
            all nibbles
- byte 2-3: Replay counter value in big endian byte order
- byte 4-6: Remote control channel's address

On some devices (see #2356) there are two extra bytes for a total of 80 bits apparently?

## TEL-FIX wall-mounted remote control for RadioLoop Motor

There is a quirk with TEL-FIX wall-mounted remote control for RadioLoop Motor:
It looks like the seed isn't random but actually the button code: 0x88 DOWN, 0x85 STOP, 0x86 UP.
The command is fixed to 0xf, which we use as idication that an actual command is in the seed.
