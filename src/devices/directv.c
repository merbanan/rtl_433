/**
DirecTV RC66RX Remote Control decoder.

The device uses FSK to transmit a PCM signal TRANSMISSION.  Its FSK signal
seems to be centered around 433.92 MHz with its MARK and SPACE frequencies
each +/- 50 kHz from that center point.

A full signal TRANSMISSION consists of ROWS, which are collections of SYMBOLS.
SYMBOLS, both the higher-frequency MARK (`1`) and lower-frequency SPACE
(`0`), have a width of 600μs.  If there is more than one ROW in a single
TRANSMISSION, there will be a GAP of 27,600μs of silence between each ROW.

A TRANSMISSION may be generated in response to an EVENT on the remote.  Observed
EVENTS that may trigger a TRANSMISSION seem limited to manual button presses.

Each ROW in the TRANSMISSION consists of two ordered parts -- its SYNC and its
MESSAGE.  Each ROW is expected to be complete; the device does not seem to ever
truncate a signal inside of a ROW.

The SYNC may be either a LONG SYNC or a SHORT SYNC. The LONG SYNC consists of
SYMBOLS `000111111111100`.  It is used in each row to signify that the MESSAGE
which follows will be the first time this unique MESSAGE will be seen in
this TRANSMISSION.

However, if a unique MESSAGE is to be sent more than once in a
TRANSMISSION, each subsequent ROW with this repeated MESSAGE will send a
SHORT SYNC instead of a LONG SYNC.  A SHORT SYNC consists of SYMBOLS
`0001111100`.

ROWS are typically repeated for the duration of the EVENT (a button push on the
remote) and a ROW is allowed to finish sending even if the EVENT ends before the
ROW is completely sent.

ROWS in any single TRANSMISSION usually contain the same MESSAGE, however this
is not always the case.  TRANSMISSIONS may be one ROW for some short EVENTS,
although some specific EVENTS generate TRANSMISSIONS of three rows, regardless
the duration of the EVENT.  Single TRANSMISSIONS have been observed to switch
from one MESSAGE to another.  This seems to happen for specific buttons, such as
the [SELECT] button, which sends a single ROW containing a LONG SYNC and a
MESSAGE that encodes a new [SELECT RELEASE] MESSAGE.  Some buttons send one
MESSAGE during the initial duration of the EVENT, but then switch to a new
MESSAGE if the EVENT continues. Some TRANSMISSIONS stop sending ROWS after a
duration even if the EVENT continues.

LOGICAL DATA in the MESSAGE may be decoded from the ROW using some sort of
Differential Pulse Width Modulation (DPWM) method.  Between each SYMBOL
transition (both `1` to `0` and `0` to `1`) consider the number of SYMBOLS.  If
there is only one SYMBOL, the LOGICAL DATA bit is a `0`.  If there are two
SYMBOLS, the LOGICAL DATA bit is a `1`.  If there are 3 or more SYMBOLS, this is
not DATA - it is a sync pulse.  If a sync pulse is found (and is followed by
more SYMBOLS i.e. the SYMBOL does not occur at the end of the ROW), both it and
the one or two contiguous SYMBOLS after it are ignored and LOGICAL DATA would
resume decoding from that next transition.

After decoding, there should be 40 bits (5 bytes) of LOGICAL DATA.

LOGICAL DATA layout in nibbles:

| 2 - 6    | DDDDD  | Device ID. 0x00000 - 0xF423F are valid (000000 - 999999 in decimal)        |
| 7 - 8    | BB     | Button Code. 0x00 - 0xFF maps to specific buttons or functions             |
| 9        | C      | Checksum. Least Significant Nibble of sum of previous 9 nibbles, 0x0 - 0xF |
