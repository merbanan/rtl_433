## Modulation

PWM with the following timings:

| Type | Pulse  | Gap     | Total   | Notes                                                        |
| ---- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0    | 365 µs |  605 µs |  970 µs | Interpreted as 1 due to short = 1 convention                 |
| 1    | 605 µs |  365 µs |  970 µs | Interpreted as 0 due to long  = 0 convention                 |
| STOP | 275 µs | 3200 µs | 3475 µs | Typically ignored due to tolerance = 50 and 275 < (365 - 50) |

## Frame Structure

1. Preamble: 01010101 + STOP
2. Payload: 72 bits + STOP, five times in a row

## Payload Structure

Nine bytes with two layers of whitening:

1. `WDDDDDDDM` (W = whitening byte, D = data byte, M = MIC byte). Ds need to be XOR'd with W.<br>
2. `DDDDDDDWM` (D = data byte, W = whitening byte, M = MIC byte). Ds need to be XOR'd with W.<br>
3. `CIITTHBIM` (C = cycle, I = ID byte, T = temperature byte, H = humidity byte, B = battery byte, M = MIC byte)

- b[0]: `PCCCCCCC` (P = 1 for pairing mode, 0 otherwise. The other bits make up a counter from 0-64 incremented each measurement cycle.)
- b[1], b[2]: Second and third sensor ID byte
- b[3], b[4]: 16-bit temperature value (int16_t, multiples of 0.1°C)
- b[5]: Relative humidity in percentage points. Base station rejects transmissions with b[5] > 127.
- b[6]: Battery level in percentage points. 0% = ~2.3V, 100% = ~3V. Base station accepts any value including 255%.
- b[7]: First sensor ID byte
- b[8]: MIC value = 0xA5 ^ xor(b[1..7]) ^ (sum(b[1..7]) & 0xFF) ^ (sum(b[1..7]) >> 8)

## Notes

Because these sensors come in sets of up to 10, and may transmit every ~10 seconds (or every 400 ms in
paring mode), we can easily encounter rows from more than one sensor in the same decoder call.
As a result it's best not to just ignore additional rows after finding one that is valid.

The MIC algorithm also isn't robust enough that a single row with a valid MIC value can be trusted.
Samples with a valid MIC value, but corrupted sensor IDs have been observed.

This decoder will report all payloads with a valid MIC value, but also report the number of rows in the same
transmission that had the same data. This way downstream consumers can filter out rows with a count of 1 if
they want to use redundancy as an additional integrity check.

    // often each reported row occurred, we first collect indexes of unique rows with the right amount of bits,
    // and count how often they occur.
    // In the most common scenario we will see five rows with 72 bits. The first row will lead to a new entry
    // in both candidate_rows and candidate_counts and the remaining four rows will be compared against
    // that first and only entry, keeping the complexity low.
    // Across more than 20,000 recordings from eight sensors, just a few contained three unique rows with enough
    // bits, and none had more. Therefore, allowing up to four candidates is probably good enough in practice.
    // In principle it would be nice to immediately discard rows with invalid MIC values, but computing the MIC value
    // requires altering the row's data, complicating the detection of duplicates. So we accept the possibility
    // that unique corrupted rows fill up the candidate arrays and prevent later valid rows from being considered.
