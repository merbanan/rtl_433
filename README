rtl_433, turns your Realtek RTL2832 based DVB dongle into a 433.92MHz generic data receiver
======================================================================

Installation instructions:

cd rtl_433/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make


Running:

./rtl_433 -h

rtl_433, an ISM band generic data receiver for RTL2832 based DVB-T receivers

Usage:	[-d device_index (default: 0)]
	[-g gain (default: 0 for auto)]
	[-a analyze mode, print a textual description of the signal]
	[-t signal auto save, use it together with analyze mode (-a -t)
	[-l change the detection level used to determine pulses (0-3200) default: 10000]
	[-f [-f...] receive frequency[s], default: 433920000 Hz]
	[-s samplerate (default: 250000 Hz)]
	[-S force sync output (default: async)]
	[-r read data from file instead of from a receiver]
	[-p ppm_error (default: 0)]
	[-r test file name (indata)]
	[-m test file mode (0 rtl_sdr data, 1 rtl_433 data)]
	[-D print debug info on event
	[-z override short value
	[-x override long value
	filename (a '-' dumps samples to stdout)


./rtl_433 -a will run in analyze mode and you will get a text log of the received signal.
./rtl_433 -a file_name will save the demodulated signal in a file, raw 8-bit pcm, at samplerate. This file can be examined in Audacity, et al.
./rtl_433 will run the software in receive mode. Some sensor data can be receviced.

This software is mostly useable for developers right now.
